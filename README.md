=================

Garamon (Geometric Algebra Recursive and Adaptative Monster) is a generator of C++ libraries dedicated to Geometric Algebra.
From a configuration file, the library generator generate the source code of the specified Algebra as well as a compatible sample code and some documentation.

Usage
=====

## Generate a library

    * define the algebra to generate: chose a configuration file (.conf) on the 'conf' directory or create your own.
    * run the binary executable (from the 'build' directory) with the configuration file as argument
      > ./garamon_generator file.conf
    * the generated library is located in 'build/output' directory
    * to install the generated library, see its README.md

## Run the Python binding sample for a specific algebra for UNIX system
Let us consider the considered algebra is CGA of R3 corresponding to the configuration file c3ga.conf. 

    * Check the dependencies
    * From Garamon Generator root directory
    	* 'mkdir build'
    	* 'cd build'
    	* 'cmake ..'
    	* 'make'
    	* './garamon_generator ../conf/c3ga.conf'
    	* 'cd output/garamon_c3ga/'
    	* 'python setup.py build'
    	* 'python setup.py install'
    	* 'cd sample'
    	* 'python sample.py'
